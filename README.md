# React-Family_tree

At the autumn semester, in my junior year at university we had to participate in a project. There were groups of 3-4 people and we were given possible project ideas. We choose to create a family tree website where people could build their family tree, save photos and even make connection with other people's tree if they had a member in common. The extra task is to be able to upload a photo and a face recognition app should recognize the person on different pictures.

This repo contains the front end part of the project.
